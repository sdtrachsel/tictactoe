# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Abstract:
Enjoy some late 80s wrestling nostlagia while playing the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe as Macho Man vs Ultimate Warrior. You can play with a friend or vs yourself. You can do best 2 out of 3 or 501 out of 1,000 with the game tracking the ultimate winner.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)






### Context:
This project was completed in apprimately 20 hours over five days during my fifth week of Turing School of Software and Design.

### Learning Goals:
Solidify and demonstrate an understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use a problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
A major win was taking the time to really plan out the steps of building the application. This allowed me to focus on one piece of functionality at a time. Another win was refactoring to have the ability to access which squares resulted in a win. This change allowed me to use the information to further manipulate what the game player sees upon winning. 

A challenge was properly alidning the grid on top of the background. The backgound image is not perfectly square so I had to manipulate it's position utlizing the x and y axis.
